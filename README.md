Efficient memory management is a crucial component of modern operating systems. When multiple processes execute simultaneously, the system divides memory into fixed-size units called pages and loads them into limited frames available in physical memory. Because the number of frames is always smaller than the total number of requested pages, the operating system must decide which page to remove whenever a new page needs to be loaded. This decision-making process is handled through page replacement algorithms.

The Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator is a simple, intuitive, and educational tool designed to help students and developers understand how these algorithms work internally. The simulator visualizes how pages move in and out of memory frames, tracks page faults and hits, and demonstrates the impact of each algorithm on performance. By providing step-by-step execution and clear frame tables, the simulator makes it easier to compare algorithms and analyze their behavior for different reference strings.

This project supports popular algorithms such as FIFO, LRU, and Optimal, and presents their results in a user-friendly interface. It serves as a practical learning resource for Operating System concepts, academic assignments, and computer science experiments.
